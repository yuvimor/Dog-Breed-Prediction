### Introduction
In this project, I used Keras and TensorFlow to build, train, and test a Convolutional Neural Network capable of identifying the breed of a dog in a supplied image.

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinehorng/dogbreedidfromcomp

The system will work on only 3 breeds due to limited computational power namely: Scottish Deerhound, Maltese Dog and Bernese Mountain Dog.

### Steps taken to build the recommender systems
- Data Collection 
- Data Processing
- Build and train the model
- Test the model
- Build the app using Streamlit
